	Actions:
	Note: some components have documentation bundled separately in a subpackage (for example suitesparse and suitesparse-doc)

	Check man pages - typos, incompatible options, vague explanations.
	Check the output --help or -h for all the binaries that are included in the errata packages.
	Examine documentation: check /usr/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME-VERSION (/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME on rhel-8). Note that every subpackage can have its own directory there.
	Check that a copy of the license for the software is present in /usr/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME-VERSION (or /usr/share/licenses/PACKAGE_NAME). The license file, eg. COPYING, COPYRIGHT or LICENSE, ought to be part of the main package, and does not have to be included in the subpackages.
	Use existing tools: Options Comparator, File Blind, Man Page Corrector
